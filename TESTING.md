[<img src="src/assets/images/devworthy_amiresponsive_whole.png" alt="An image representing how the site looks across different devices of varying size.">](https://anthonyradose.github.io/dev-worthy/#/)

Manual testing was conducted throughout development to ensure all features performed as expected across multiple screen sizes, user flows, and edge cases.

## ✅ Automated Testing

### 🧼 HTML & CSS Validation (via [W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org/))

#### HTML

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/) was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the site along with validation of CSS.

<details>
  <summary><strong>Index HTML: No Errors ✅</strong></summary>
  <br>
  <img src="src/assets/images/devworthy_w3_index.png" alt="No Errors found." style="border: 2px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px; max-width: 100%;">
</details>

<details>
  <summary><strong>404 HTML: No Errors ✅</strong></summary>
  <br>
  <img src="src/assets/images/devworthy_w3_404.png" alt="No Errors found." style="border: 2px solid #ccc; border-radius: 8px; max-width: 100%;">
</details>

>
> #### 404 Testing notes
>At the time of testing there were elements of CSS and JS within the file.
>The HTML ONLY was tested here.
>The separation and integration of separate styling and script files may need to be implemented in >future, due to time constraints.
>

#### CSS

<details><summary><strong>Credits.module.css: No Errors ✅</strong></summary>
<img src="src/assets/images/devworthy_w3_css_creditsmodule.png" alt="No Errors found.">
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Favorites.module.css: 2x Parse errors ⚠️</strong></summary>

</details>

<details><summary><strong>Footer.module.css: No Errors ✅</strong></summary>
<img src="src/assets/images/devworthy_w3_css_footermodule.png" alt="No Errors found.">
</details>

<details><summary><strong>Navbar.module.css: No Errors ✅</strong></summary>
<img src="src/assets/images/devworthy_w3_css_navbarmodule.png" alt="No Errors found.">
</details>

<details><summary><strong>QuoteCard.module.css: No Errors ✅</strong></summary>
<img src="src/assets/images/devworthy_w3_css_quotecardmodule.png" alt="No Errors found.">
</details>

<details><summary><strong>index.css: No Errors ✅</strong></summary>
<img src="src/assets/images/devworthy_w3_css_index.png" alt="No Errors found.">
</details>

> ### ⚠️ Parse errors: Favourites.module.css  
>  
> The W3C validator reports a "parse error" in the `Favourites.module.css` file due to the use of `:global` selectors, which are specific to CSS Modules used in modern React applications.  
>  
> These selectors are intentionally used to style third-party components (e.g., carousel navigation buttons) that exist outside the scope of the local module, which is a common and supported approach in React with CSS Modules.  
>  
> The validator does not recognize this syntax because it is not part of standard CSS—it is a build-time feature handled by the React development environment (e.g., Webpack or Vite).  
>  
> ✅ The styles render correctly in all modern browsers, and removing or altering them to satisfy the validator would break essential carousel functionality and styling. Therefore, this code is valid within the context of the project and does not need to be changed.

### 📜 JavaScript Validation

#### React Application Testing Overview

The React application was tested using **Vitest** and **React Testing Library**, focusing on key components and pages:

## 🔗 Test Files

- [QuoteCard.test.jsx](./src/components/QuoteCard.test.jsx)
- [Favourites.test.jsx](./src/pages/Favourites.test.jsx)
- [NotFound.test.jsx](./src/pages/NotFound.test.jsx)

---

#### 🧪 Testing Stack

| Tool | Version |
|------|---------|
| **Vitest** | v3.1.1 |
| **React Testing Library** | v16.3.0 |
| **jsdom** | v26.1.0 |
| **Router** | React Router DOM |
| **Mocking** | Vitest mocks (`vi`) |

---

#### ✅ Component Test Coverage

| Component   | Test Scenarios                                                                 | Status |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| **QuoteCard** | Initial render, fetch quotes, button functionality, saving & duplicate logic | ✅ |
| **Favourites** | Empty state, loading from `localStorage`, rendering saved quotes             | ✅ |
| **NotFound**   | Rendering of 404 content, link back to homepage                              | ✅ |

---

#### 📂 Test File Links

- [`QuoteCard.test.jsx`](../path/to/QuoteCard.test.jsx)
- [`Favourites.test.jsx`](../path/to/Favourites.test.jsx)
- [`NotFound.test.jsx`](../path/to/NotFound.test.jsx)

---

#### 🧩 Mock Implementations

- **`localStorage` Mock**: used in `Favourites` tests for simulating saved quotes.
- **`fetch` Mock**: used in `QuoteCard` to simulate quote API responses.

---

#### 🔍 Testing Approaches

- Async handling with `waitFor` and `act`
- UI assertions with `toBeInTheDocument()`
- Button click simulation with `fireEvent`
- Setup/cleanup with `beforeEach`, `afterEach`

---

#### 🛠️ Vitest Configuration

>// vitest.config.js
>import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';
>import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react';
>
>export default defineConfig({
>  plugins: [react()],
>  test: {
>    environment: 'jsdom',
>    globals: true,
>    setupFiles: ['./src/setupTests.js'],
>    css: true,
>  },
>});
>

📋 Best Practices Applied

✅ Isolated component testing
✅ Mocking external dependencies
✅ Asserting both UI elements and behavior
✅ Testing error and edge cases
✅ Clean test setup with beforeEach and afterEach
