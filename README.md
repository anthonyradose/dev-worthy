This is the documentation for DevWorthy – a motivational web app designed to support aspiring developers in overcoming imposter syndrome. Built using ReactJS with JSX, Tailwind CSS for styling, and modern JavaScript practices, the site was developed as part of the April 2025 Code Institute Hackathon.


## Criteria


1) The team has built one of the 5 suggested projects
2) The team has innovated on their choice of project
3) The project is fully responsive
4) The project is well planned using github projects or other issues board

## User Experience - UX


### Strategy


This project has been built as a collaborative project through [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) as a learning tool for working in an professional environment through:


* Teamwork
* Exposure to Agile Development
* Experience with version control
* Adding to CV and portfolio
* Exposure on social pedia
* Delivering projects to tight deadlines


 The aim is to create a site that spreads positive and uplifting messages that users can view daily to remind themselves that they are worthy of the goals they pursue.


#### User Goals


- View inspiring quotes
- View coding tips and tricks
- Save quotes to favourites
- View information about the team

### Scope


The scope of DevWorthy was to create a clean, uplifting web app that delivers motivational content to developers experiencing imposter syndrome. The MVP focused on displaying daily affirmations, ensuring accessibility, responsiveness, and a positive user experience. Features such as user accounts, quote submissions, or personalization were considered out of scope for the hackathon timeframe but could be explored in future iterations. The project emphasized clean UI, mobile-first design, and showcasing modern frontend development tools within a short development sprint.

### Structure


#### Site Structure


As the purpose of the initial site is quite simple, the navigation route will be linear and will encourage users to view new quotes, view the dev team's information, and view their favourite quotes. This will be the order that the pages appear in the navigation bar along with interactive quote saving/removing and links within the content of the pages to encourage users to click over to the next area of the site.

- __Home Page:__ When users first navigate to the site they are taken to the index.html page, this provides users with an inspiring quote. Users can choose to add their quote to favourites or view a different quote.


- __Credits Page:__ Users can view information about the April 2025 hackathon team 4!


- __Favourites Page:__ Users can view their favourite quotes and remove them.

## User Interface - Design


### Surface


The design of the site has been implemented using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) styling across the site. This framework was chosen due to the experience of team members. Streamlining the main aspects of the site's style allowed for members to spend more time with functionality and content creation.


#### Typography


Fonts have been imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).


[Poppins:](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) This geometric sans-serif font is used for headers and titles due to its modern, stylish appearance and strong visual presence. Its clean lines and bold weights make it ideal for grabbing attention while maintaining clarity and professionalism.


[Roboto:](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto) This sans-serif font is used for the main body text due to its clean, modern look and excellent readability, especially on mobile devices and at small sizes.


#### Colours

>This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.
>
>Currently, two official plugins are available:
>
>- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) >uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
>- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/>plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
>
>##### Expanding the ESLint configuration
>
>If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint >rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/>create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`]>(https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
