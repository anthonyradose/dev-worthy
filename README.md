This is the documentation for DevWorthy - an uplifting daily boost web app aimed towards combating imposter syndrome in aspiring web developers. The site has been built using HTML5, CSS3 with bootstrap templating, and ReactJS for the April 2025 Code Institute hackathon.


## Criteria


1) The team has built one of the 5 suggested projects
2) The team has innovated on their choice of project
3) The project is fully responsive
4) The project is well planned using github projects or other issues board

## User Experience - UX


### Strategy


This project has been built as a collaborative project through [Code Institute](https://codeinstitute.net/) as a learning tool for working in an professional environment through:


* Teamwork
* Exposure to Agile Development
* Experience with version control
* Adding to CV and portfolio
* Exposure on social pedia
* Delivering projects to tight deadlines


 The aim is to create a site that spreads positive and uplifting messages that users can view daily to remind themselves that they are worthy of the goals they pursue.




#### User Goals


- View inspiring quotes
- View coding tips and tricks --tbc
- Save quotes to favourites


<sup><sub>[*Back to top*](#devworthy)</sup></sub>


-----


### Scope


Taking all of the above into account we decided‚Ä¶‚Ä¶


- __Home Page:__ When users first navigate to the site they are taken to the index.html page, this provides users with an inspiring quote. Users can choose to add their quote to favourites or view a different quote.


- __Favourites Page:__ Users can view their favourite quotes and remove them.


- __Credits Page:__ Users can view information about the April 2025 hackathon team 4!

### Structure


#### Site Structure


As the purpose of the initial site is quite simple, the navigation route will be linear and will encourage users to view new quotes, view their favourite quotes, and view the dev team's information. This will be the order that the pages appear in the navigation bar along with interactive quote saving/removing and links within the content of the pages to encourage users to click over to the next area of the site.

## User Interface - Design


### Surface


The design of the site has been implemented using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) styling across the site. This framework was chosen due to the experience of team members. Streamlining the main aspects of the site's style allowed for members to spend more time with functionality and content creation.


#### Typography


Fonts have been imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).


[Poppins:](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins)


[Roboto:](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=roboto) This sans-serif font is used for the main body text due to its clean, modern look and excellent readability, especially on mobile devices and at small sizes.


#### Colours


The colour scheme for the site‚Ä¶




Colour scheme images made with [coolers](https://coolors.co).

# React + Vite




This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.




Currently, two official plugins are available:




- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh




## Expanding the ESLint configuration




If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
